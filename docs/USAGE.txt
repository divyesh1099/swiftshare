   * Navigate to your system’s terminal (Linux/MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).
2. Navigate to Application Directory:
Change the directory to where the IDAK application is located with the cd command:

   *    * Ensure that you are using the correct version of Python if multiple versions are installed on your system. You may need to use python3 instead of python.
Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Upon launching the application, a GUI window will open if the application requires you to select a folder:
1. Select Folder:
   * Use the file dialog to navigate to and select the folder containing your Excel file and attachments.
2. Confirmation:
   * Confirm your selection, and the GUI will close, allowing the application to proceed with sending emails.
Excel File Format
* The Excel file should have specific columns for:
   * EmailAddress: Recipient’s email address.
   * SubjectLine: Subject line for the email.
   * Body: The body of the email, which can be in RTF format.
   * OrderRef: A reference to any attachments by filename, separated by commas if multiple.
Sending Emails
After you have selected the folder with the GUI:
1. Processing:
   * The application will read the Excel file and process each row as an individual email.
2. Converting Content:
   * If the body of the email is in RTF format, the application will automatically convert it to HTML.
3. Attaching Files:
   * The application will attach any files referenced in the OrderRef column of the Excel file to the respective email.
4. Dispatching Emails:
   * Emails will be sent to each recipient with the customized subject and body, along with any attachments.
Monitoring Progress

* You can monitor this output to track the progress of the email sending process.
* Any errors encountered during the process will be logged here.
Completion
* Once the application has processed all entries in the Excel file, it will finish running, and you will see a completion message in the terminal or command prompt window.
Error Handling
* If an error occurs, the application will log a descriptive message to help diagnose the issue.
* Common errors may include issues with file paths, email server connectivity, or formatting errors in the Excel file.
